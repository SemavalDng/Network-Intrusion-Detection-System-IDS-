# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-

This project aims to design a simple machine learning based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
while focusing on developing a fundamental understanding of network security concepts. 
Using the NSL-KDD dataset(filtered, not original version), the model will learn to classify network 
connections as normal or attack based on extracted features such as protocol type, service, and 
flag. 
Beyond model implementation, the project emphasizes learning how different types of network 
attacks (such as DoS, Probe, R2L,…) manifest in data, and how IDSs help in identifying them. 
Supervised learning models such as Decision Tree and Logistic Regression are applying, 
and their performance will be evaluated using metrics lik accuracy, precision, and recall.
